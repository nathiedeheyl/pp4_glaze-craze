# The Glaze Craze
Where creativity meets community â€“ design, vote, and collect pottery with Glaze Drops!

## General

### Project purpose

The Glaze Craze is a pottery-focused web platform where users can submit design ideas, vote for their favorites using a points-based system called Glaze Drops, and "purchase" featured pottery items with these points. The project showcases skills in user authentication, CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) for design submissions, a voting system, and an interactive shop experience, all tied to a gamified currency (the Glaze Drops). It mimics an e-commerce experience while fostering community engagement through comments and voting, without involving real payments.

### Project Scope

**Core Goals:**
  - Build a user-friendly web application that includes user authentication (sign-up, log in and stay logged in, log out), user interactions (create, save, edit, delete and interact with other user's posts), and item-based transactions
  - Introduce a gamified system with Glaze Drops to add interactivity and user engagement

**Key Features:**
  - User registration and login with a "remember me" feature
  - Database for storing user data, Glaze Drops balance, and shared and "purchased" pottery designs
  - Functionality to create edit, delete, and share design submissions ("items")
  - A voting and commenting system for designs
  - A "shop" where users can spend Glaze Drops on pottery items or their designs
