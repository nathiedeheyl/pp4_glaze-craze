# The Glaze Craze
Where creativity meets community â€“ design, vote, and collect pottery with Glaze Drops!

## General

### Project purpose

The Glaze Craze is a pottery-focused web platform where users can submit design ideas, vote for their favorites using a points-based system called Glaze Drops, and "purchase" featured pottery items with these points. The project showcases skills in user authentication, CRUD functionality (create, read, update, delete) for design submissions, a voting system, and an interactive shop experience, all tied to a gamified currency (the Glaze Drops). It mimics an e-commerce experience while fostering community engagement through comments and voting, without involving real payments.
